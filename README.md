# text_classification_for_sentiment_analysis
In this project, I explored text classification using the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Naive Bayes models. The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) demonstrated a remarkable accuracy rate of 96.49%, whilst the Naive Bayes classifier produced a comparatively lower accuracy rate of 83.67%.
